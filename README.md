### Getting Started

Blazor Datasheet provides a **Datasheet** Blazor component that accepts a Sheet.

A Sheet holds the data and configuration for a Datasheet. The data is set per Cell, or can be built using the ObjectEditorBuilder, which creates a datasheet based on a list of objects.

The following code displays an empty 3 x 3 data grid.

```csharp
<Datasheet
    Sheet="sheet"/>

@code{

    private Sheet sheet;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        sheet = new Sheet(3, 3);
    }

}
```

The default editor is the text editor, but can be changed by defining the Type property of each cell.
